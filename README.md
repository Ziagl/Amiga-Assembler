# Amiga Assembler

This is the source code for my Amiga Assembler series. This small examples demonstrate how to write assembler code for Amiga systems.
All examples are compiled with VASM, an portable assembler that supports a range of retro CPUs.
The generated executables were tested with success on a virtual Amiga 1200 system.

## binary operation

first simple example on how to set values to data registers and compute binary operations on it

## status register

both examples demonstrate with simple operations on how status register bits are set.

## subroutines

this sample shows how to write subroutines

A detailed text on how to set up a toolchain and virtual Amigas and detailed explainations of each example can be found on my blog starting here (in German language):
